  We just covered the
  <em>
   if
  </em>
  statement, which executes code if an evaluation is true and skips the code if it’s false. But what if we wanted the code to do something different if the evaluation is false? We can do this using the
  <em>
   else
  </em>
  statement. The
  <em>
   else
  </em>
  statement follows an
  <em>
   if
  </em>
  block, and is composed of the keyword
  <em>
   else
  </em>
  followed by a colon. The body of the
  <em>
   else
  </em>
  statement is indented to the right, and will be expected if the above
  <em>
   if
  </em>
  statement doesn’t execute.

  We also touched on the modulo operator, which is represented by the percent sign:
  <strong>
   %
  </strong>
  . This operator performs integer division, but only returns the remainder of this division operation. If we’re dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. Two 2s can go into 5, leaving 1 left over. So 5%2 would return 1. Dividing 10 by 5 would give us a quotient of 2 with no remainder, since 5 can go into 10 twice with nothing left over. In this case, 10%2 would return 0, as there is no remainder.
