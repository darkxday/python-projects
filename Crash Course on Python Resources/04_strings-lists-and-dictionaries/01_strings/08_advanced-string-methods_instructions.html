  We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  The string method
  <strong>
   lower
  </strong>
  will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the
  <strong>
   upper
  </strong>
  method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like
  <strong>
   "this is a string".upper()
  </strong>
  . This would return the string
  <strong>
   "THIS IS A STRING"
  </strong>
  . This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can use the
  <strong>
   strip
  </strong>
  method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods
  <strong>
   lstrip
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   rstrip
  </strong>
  to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  The method
  <strong>
   count
  </strong>
  can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method
  <strong>
   endswith
  </strong>
  . This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   isnumeric
  </strong>
  method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the
  <strong>
   int()
  </strong>
  function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!
 </p>
 <p>
  We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the
  <strong>
   join
  </strong>
  method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example,
  <strong>
   " ".join(["This","is","a","sentence"])
  </strong>
  would return the string
  <strong>
   "This is a sentence"
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The inverse of the join method is the
  <strong>
   split
  </strong>
  method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.
