   <span>
    While loops can be used with all data types, for loops can only be used with numbers.

   <span>
    For loops can be nested, but while loops can't.

   <span>
    While loops iterate while a condition is true, for loops iterate through a sequence of elements.

 Question 2
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.

 Question 3
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Write a script that prints the first 10 cube numbers (x**3), starting with x=1 and ending with x=10.
 </p>

<h3>
 Question 4
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.

<h3>
 Question 5
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  The retry function tries to execute an operation that might fail, it retries the operation for a number of attempts.  Currently the code will keep executing the function even if it succeeds. Fill in the blank so the code stops trying after the operation succeeded.
