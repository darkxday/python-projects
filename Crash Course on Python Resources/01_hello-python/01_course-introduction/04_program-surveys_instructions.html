  Entry survey

 <p>
  In the following course item, you'll have the opportunity to fill out a brief survey to help us understand why youâ€™ve enrolled in this class. If you do not fill it out, you'll receive an invitation to fill out the survey after completing one lecture or assignment.

  We will ask about your experiences leading up to this course, and what you hope to accomplish. This is critical information for making sure we can meet the needs of learners like you, and can offer this program in the future.
