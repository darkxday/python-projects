  Welcome to the course!
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course is designed to teach you the foundations of programming in Python. We’re excited to join you on this journey as you learn one of the most-in-demand job skills in IT today. In the U.S. alone, according to Burning Glass data from May 2019, there were ~530K job openings in 2018 asking for Python skills.

  Course prerequisites
 </h3>
 <p>
  This course requires no previous knowledge of programming. Familiarity with basic IT concepts, like operating systems, files and processes, networking and data management will be required in further courses. For learners with no IT background at all, we recommend taking the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-it-support" title="">
   IT Support Professional Certificate 101
  </a>
  .

  How to pass the class
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Course Certificate gives you a way to prove your new programming skills to employers. To qualify for the certificate, you have to enroll in the program, pay the fee, and pass the graded assessments. If you don’t want to pay, you can still audit the course for free. This lets you view all videos and submit practice quizzes as you learn. One thing to remember though, this option doesn’t let you submit assessments, earn a grade, or receive the certificate.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  How deadlines work
 </h3>
 <p>
  When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There’s no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.

  Getting and giving help
 </h3>
 <p>
  Here are a few ways you can give and get help:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    Discussion forums: You can share information and ideas with your fellow learners in the discussion forums. These are also great places to find answers to questions you may have. If you're stuck on a concept, are struggling to solve a practice exercise, or you just want more information on a subject, the discussion forums are there to help you move forward.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Coursera learner support: Use the
    <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us" title="">
     Learner Help Center
    </a>
    to find information on specific technical issues. These include error messages, difficulty submitting assignments, or problems with video playback. If you can’t find an answer in the documentation, you can also report your problem to the Coursera support team by clicking on the Contact Us! link available at the bottom of help center articles.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Course content issues: You can also flag problems in course materials by rating them. When you rate course materials, the instructor will see your ratings and feedback; other learners won’t. To rate course materials:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Open the course material you want to rate. You can only rate videos, readings, and quizzes.

  Finding out more information
 </h3>
 <p>
  Throughout this course, we'll be teaching you the basics of programming and automation. We'll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings. But sometimes, you may also need to look things up on your own, now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research so you stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find additional information— it’s great practice for the real world!

 <p>
  On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The official
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" title="">
     Python tutorial
    </a>
    . This tutorial is designed to help people teach themselves Python. While it goes in a different order than the one we're taking here, it covers a lot of the same subjects that we explore in this course. You can refer to this resource for extra information on these subjects.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The
    <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/" title="">
     Think Python
    </a>
    book. This book aims to teach people how to program in Python. It's available online in PDF and browsable forms. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about some of the subjects we cover.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html" title="">
   official language reference
  </a>
  . This is a technical reference of all Python language components. At first, this resource might be a little too complex, but as you learn how Python works and how it’s built, this can be a useful reference to understand the details of these interactions.
