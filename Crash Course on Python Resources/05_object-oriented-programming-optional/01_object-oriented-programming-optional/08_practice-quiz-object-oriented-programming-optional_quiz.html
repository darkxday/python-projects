 Question 1
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Let’s test your knowledge of using dot notation to access methods and attributes in an object. Let’s say we have a class called Birds. Birds has two attributes: color and number. Birds also has a method called count() that counts the number of birds (adds a value to number). Which of the following lines of code will correctly print the number of birds? Keep in mind, the number of birds is 0 until they are counted!

 Question 2
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Creating new instances of class objects can be a great way to keep track of values using attributes associated with the object. The values of these attributes can be easily changed at the object level.  The following code illustrates a famous quote by George Bernard Shaw, using objects to represent people. Fill in the blanks to make the code satisfy the behavior described in the quote.

<h3>
 Question 3
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  The City class has the following attributes: name, country (where the city is located), elevation (measured in meters), and population (approximate, according to recent statistics). Fill in the blanks of the max_elevation_city function to return the name of the city and its country (separated by a comma), when comparing the 3 defined instances for a specified minimal population. For example, calling the function for a minimum population of 1 million: max_elevation_city(1000000) should return "Sofia, Bulgaria".

 Question 5
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  We have two pieces of furniture: a brown wood table and a red leather couch. Fill in the blanks following the creation of each Furniture class instance, so that the describe_furniture function can format a sentence that describes these pieces as follows: "This piece of furniture is made of {color} {material}"
